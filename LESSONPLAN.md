# Lesson Plan

#### Week 1 - Introduction to Molecular Dynamics

Young computational chemists often suffer from "black box syndrome" at the start of their career as they don't quite grasp what the programs that they use are actually doing. In this course the first week will be dedicated to stripping away the "black box" and giving students an understanding of molecular dynamics simulations. This means that in the subsequent weeks, students will be able to better understand the simulations that they are running.   

##### Learning Outcomes 


##### Lesson Plan


##### Assesment 

- Open for debate
- This week will form the basis for the methodology portion of the students report
  
  #### Week 2 - Introduction to Transport Properties

The transport properties of a material are crucial for many technologies. These range from batteries/fuel cells to nuclear materials. Week 2 will take the knowledge of MD simulations learnt in week 1 and apply it to some real world examples. Students will run MD simulations on fluorite $CaF_2$ and analyse the transport properties of the material. 

##### Learning Outcomes 

- Mean Squared Displacement - Tutorial in Jupyter notebook
- Arhenius Equation - Tutorial in Jupyter notebook

##### Lesson Plan

- Run an intitial MD simulation on $CaF_2$ - Use this data to do MSD tutorial
- Run MD simulations on $CaF_2$ across a temperature range - Use data for Arhenius tutorial

##### Assesment 

- MSD / Arhenius theory will form part of the methodology of the students report
- The Arenius plot for $CaF_2$ will be required for the report   
  
#### Week 3 - Defect Chemistry

No material is without defects. There are two main types of defect that exist in materials - Frenkel and Schottky defects. 
- Frenkel Defect = Interstitials 
- Schottky Defect = Missing formaula unit  

In week 3 students will introduce Frenkel and Schottky defects to the $CaF_2$ configuration from week 2. They will determine how these defects affect the tranpsort properties of the material. 
This will be the first week that does not include tutorials, the students will begin to use what they have learned in the first 2 weeks and begin to design their own simulations. 

##### Learning Outcomes

- Understand Frenkel and Schottky defects 

##### Lesson Plan

- Add cation Frenkel defects to  $CaF_2$ and vary the concentration - How do Frenkel defects affect the transport properties
- Add Schottky defects to $CaF_2$ and vary the concentration - How do Schottky defects affect the transport properties. 

##### Assesment 

- Key Report Question - How do Frenkel/Schottky defects affect the transport properties? 
  
#### Week 4 - Dopants 

It is now common practice to dope a material with different elements in order to improve a desired property. This is particularly common in fuel cell materials, eg Cerium oxide is doped with $Gd^{3+}$ cations in order to improve the oxygen transport(and conductivity) of the material - making it a better fuel cell material. In the final week students will investigate how dopant cations affect the transport properties of $CaF_2$. Can they find a way to increase the diffusion coefficient?

##### Learning Outcomes

- How do you as a scientist alter the properties of a material?

##### Lesson Plan

- Select 4 - 5 cations and add them to $CaF_2$. 

##### Assesment 

- Key Report Question - How do dopants affect the tranport properties.   
   
#### Summary 

Over the 4 weeks the students will transition from a very hands on, teaching focused course to a hands off, research driven course. In weeks 1 and 2 the students will learn the underlying theory behind the practical course and how to carry out MD simulations. In weeks 3 and 4 the students will use this knowledge to design simulations to answer questions common to computational chemists.
